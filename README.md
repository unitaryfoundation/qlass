# QLASS
Package to compile quantum algorithms on photonic devices. Part of the Quantum Glass-based Photonic Integrated Circuits ([QLASS](https://www.qlass-project.eu/))
project funded by the European Union. 

## Installing QLASS
The development install of QLASS requirements can be done by setting the working directory to the top level of the repository and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
QLASS builds upon open-source scientific software packages in Python: `scipy` for numerical optimization, `pyscf` and `qiskit-nature` for quantum chemistry, `qiskit` for quantum computing, and `perceval` for quantum photonics compilation.

## Getting started
You can use [this notebook on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)](https://github.com/unitaryfund/QLASS/blob/main/photonic_vqe.ipynb) to get started with the QLASS package.

## Documentation
The main functions of the package are commented using the Google style format. 

## Contributing
QLASS is developed by [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.foundation/), in collaboration with QLASS performers.

You can join the UF [Discord server](http://discord.unitary.fund) for community support.
